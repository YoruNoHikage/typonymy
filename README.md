# Typonymy

This project is made to relate parametric typefaces to contexts. Initially made to work in cartography field.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
yarn start

# or
npm install
npm start
```

## How does it work

### Projects

This tab works exactly like [Prototypo](https://prototypo.io). You create projects and set parameters values with sliders.

### Contextualize

For each context you have, you define key points and change the style of your base projects. The usability is pretty close to what you can find in the [animation tool in Adobe Premiere](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/adding-navigating-setting-keyframes.html).

### Preview

In this tab, you change values for each context. Each projects should adjust linearly according to what you set in contextualize.
You can export data into a file to save your changes. The work is also saved locally so you don't have to worry of losing if you close the page.
